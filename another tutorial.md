## Assembly
> Tip: before laying down any chips, spray your baking sheet with cooking spray, or a light layer of cooking oil. This will prevent the cheese from forming a (although delicious) sticky bond between chips and baking sheet thus making them difficult to transfer to your plate when you're ready to enjoy. 

> Tip: for a superior nacho experience, build your nachos in layers! Kinda like lasagne! After a base layer of chips, sprinkle cheese on top. Now, another layer of chips, follwed by another layer of cheese. After you've built this foundation, add your chosen toppings.

> Tip: if you're using guacamole wait until the nachos are done baking before adding the guacamole. Baking the guacamole will ruin the flavor and turn it an ugly color no one wants to eat.
